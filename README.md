We are delighted to have you here and wish you a great experience at this event!

## The Task

The e.GO life is generating, collecting and processing serveral data per second. Those data could be very valuable for us. Especially when you think of developing new innovative business models. Your task is to develop value-adding services for the e.GO Life and its user considering the provided data. 

## Delivery of the projects & pitching

The delivery of the project will mainly be via Github. There you can upload your files. Additionally, we will need a documentation of your work. This should include:

* Your names: Dominik BiÃŸlich, Jan-Philip Erdmann, Philine Lichtenberg, Thomas Bangert, Philipp Heisenberger
* The title of your project: e.CO:mobility
* A description of 
  * What the project can do/is supposed to do
  We worked nearly 32 hours straight to get the best solution for the future of e.Go and e.Go Digital. Our aim was to achieve
  a new, great e.Co system around the e.Go Life, e.Go Moover and e.Go Kart and, maybe in the future the e.Go Scooter.
  We used the Seamless Mobility concept to develop different services and business models. Concepts like gamification were 
  integrated in our small backend application. We also build a mockup APP to present the UX and UI look and feel. 
  We manly use the supplied data with a small extensions regarding the available sensor data. The calculated gamification 
  score is shown on the infotainment screen. We prepared a documentation presentation where you can find further information 
  about our project.
  
* Also think about adding screenshots and pictures
* Feedback sheet

**Deadline** for your results is on Friday 4pm. You will have to pitch your idea in a 3-minutes-presentation. A jury will evaluate all presentations through aspects like degree of innovation, UX/UI and simplification. Keep that in mind and become one of the qualified teams for the final pitching session. The overall winning team will be honored and is getting an attractive price.
